#	Project Theory on remote sensing about Bridges/Building cracks


### What is Remote Sensing?
It is the process of colleecting information about an area from distance without physically touching it - usually using satallites, drones, or aircrafts


### What we use!
 A sensor(camera,radar or scanner) palcesd on a sataite or aircraft.that capture a data from images or signals and processeed to ectract information.


 #### we have two type of Remote sensing 
 1. Passive - uses natural energy like  satalite photos,thermal images
 2. Active - sends own signal and measures the reflaction like radar, lidar

##
 To decet creacks in building/bridges we need high-precising sensor that can identify the structural dammage in erly stage.
 1. Ultrasonic Sensor -- high frequency sound waves, detect internal cracks.
 2. Acoustic emission snesors -- high frequency sound, crack monitiring and veery sensitive.
 3. Visual or OPtical sensor -- images or video, surface-level cracks.
 4. light detection and ranging (LiDAR) -- send laser beam and measure the returns to map 3D surface,surface  deformation or uneven areas
 5. Strain Gauges --material straches or compress (steel/concreate), long term monitoring, detect unusual strain before cracks form
 6. Thermal sensor(Infrared) -- temprature dection , craks traps heat and show up as hot spot
