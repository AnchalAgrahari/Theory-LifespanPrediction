We are developing an AI-based system that uses remote sensing data to:
*detect hidden cracks or stress points in bridges/building
* monitors changes over time to pridict structural lifespan
* give erly warning alerts before failure or collapse



### Multiple Sensors 
thermal, LiDAR, and ultrasound ---Detect internal + surface cracks invisible

### AI-Powered Image & Signal Processing 
Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect micro-cracks from high-res images.
Apply time-series models (e.g., LSTM) to analyze structural health over time.

### Lifespan Prediction Model
Train a model using previous bridge failure datasets.
Output Remaining Useful Life (RUL) as a percentage or in years.


### Remote Monitoring via Drones
Equip drones with sensors and AI for autonomous inspection.
Real-time data upload to a cloud-based dashboard.


### Alert + Reporting System
Generate PDF health reports.
SMS or app notifications for early warnings to engineers or authorities.
