We are developing an AI-based system that uses remote sensing data to:
*detect hidden cracks or stress points in bridges/building
* monitors changes over time to pridict structural lifespan
* give erly warning alerts before failure or collapse


###Multiple Sensors --thermal, LiDAR, and ultrasound ---Detect internal + surface cracks invisible
###AI-Powered Image & Signal Processing --Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect micro-cracks from high-res images.
Apply time-series models (e.g., LSTM) to analyze structural health over time.
